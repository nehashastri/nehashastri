#  👋 Hi there, I'm Neha Shastri!

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Neha—a data enthusiast driven by curiosity and creativity. With a background in **Computer Science & Engineering** and hands-on experience in **data science**, **machine learning**, and **cloud technologies**, I’m passionate about turning data into insights that solve real-world problems.

Currently, I’m pursuing my **Master’s in Business Analytics** at BU Questrom, specializing in **Data & Methods**. I’m fortunate to be supported by the **Director’s Achievement Scholarship** and am actively engaged in case competitions and collaborative analytics projects.

My goal is to work in **Data Analyst** or **Data Scientist** roles where I can blend technical knowledge with strategic thinking to drive business impact.
